    content: `A journey to senior software engineer. With an incredibly talented team, we designed and developed a software architecture using cloud services to create a centralized system of company data to enable complex scientific queries. I'm responsible for several lead roles including, but not limited to, web development, CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions), and a software engineering internship.
      From zero to hero in the span of 7 months, I learned about cloud services (AWS) and how to deploy a system of scalable serverless web services to achieve a data lake. I built and actively maintain the frontend (SvelteKit), the backend APIs (Django), and PostgreSQL databases.
      So what have I learned? I learned to spot inefficiencies in the software development pipeline and how to alleviate it. I learned to setup a scalable cloud architecture using containerized services. I learned to speak up to offer my professional opinion and advise on the best course of action. I learned to directly interface with stakeholders who aren't computer proficient. I learned when to lead and when to follow.`,

    subtitle: "Full Stack Software Engineer",
    content: `Here I worked on a variety of applications. I started with .NET C# applications before transitioning to the web development team. As a web developer, I was a major contributor for three core products: Nexus Video Portal (NVP), Enterprise Management System (EMS), Nexus Communication Service (NCS).
      NVP and EMS are web clients to an integrated network of audio/video streaming devices. I was responsible for the development of the user interface and resource controls. Written in vanilla JavaScript, Java, and ThymeLeaf, I ensured that the user interface remained intuitive and responsive.
      NCS is an API service that manages data interactions within the enterprise system. I was responsible for the development of the API endpoints and the database schema (MySQL). Written in Java and Hibernate, I ensured scalable database queries and a smooth migration of multiple core products.
      So what did I gain? Invaluable experience and domain knowledge working in a complex network of people and products. I learned effective communication and project/task/time management to meet deadlines.`,

    subtitle: "Electrical Engineering Intern",
    content: `Over the course of two summer internships, I built multiple mobile test benches for electrical control systems. In addition, I assembled space-grade electrical cables and upkept a stock room of electrical components.
      The manufacturing of each mobile test benches involves connecting thousands of wires and dozens of electrical components by hand. The test bench was loaded with LabView before performing electromechanical tests on aircraft components.
      So what did I learn? I learned how to solder, crimp, and connect wires. I learned how to read electrical schematics and wire diagrams. I learned how to use a variety of electrical tools and equipment. I learned how to work in a team and communicate effectively.`,

    subtitle: "Bachelor's in Computer Science",
    content: `During my time at the university, I was a research member of the distributed systems laboratory and the FSAE team. I also worked as a Teaching Assistant for undergraduate computer science courses.
      I initially entered the university pursing electrical engineering, but after discovering an aptitude for programming, I decided to switch to computer science. Once the world of computers was opened to me, I took initiative to learn as much as I could. I took courses in machine learning, databases, and cloud computing. I also participated in multiple Hackathons to further my knowledge.
      So what did I learn? I learned multiple engineering product development lifecycles and how to apply them. I learned the theories and fundamentals; and most importantly, I learned how to learn.`,
