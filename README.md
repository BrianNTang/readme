The long overdue frontend developer profile. Here I plan to learn a new framework and showcase a
_cool_ design as an ethusiast of frontend technologies.

## Quickstart

```zsh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Deployment

I aim to deploy this project initially on GitHub Pages. Possible alternatives include Netlify and Vercel.

```zsh
pnpm run build
pnpm run deploy # pnpm deploy and pnpm run deploy are different
```
